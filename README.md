# ENS I AM DEFI WORKSHOP
### 1. **Introduction to Web3 Domains & Decentralized Hosting**

---

#### **What We’ll Cover:**

##### **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)**:
- **Overview**: The **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** is often referred to as the "domain name system for Web3." Instead of long, complex Ethereum wallet addresses (e.g., `0xABC123...`), ENS allows users to register human-readable names like `yourname.eth`, which can be mapped to Ethereum addresses or decentralized websites.
- **Launched in**: ENS was launched on **May 4, 2017**, on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **How It Works**: Like the traditional DNS (Domain Name System) that converts `example.com` into a server IP address, ENS does the same but for Web3 resources like cryptocurrency wallets, decentralized websites, or smart contracts. The ENS names can be used to send crypto, interact with dApps, or point to decentralized content.
- **Curious Fact**: ENS names can include not only `.eth` domains but also domains from other naming systems like `.xyz` and `.luxe`. As of September 2023, ENS had registered over **3.5 million domains**, showing its growing adoption in Web3.

##### **Ethereum Basics**:
- **Overview**: **Ethereum** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Created by **Vitalik Buterin** and launched in **2015**, it was designed to go beyond Bitcoin’s capabilities by supporting complex applications.
- **dApps and Smart Contracts**: Ethereum allows the creation of **decentralized applications (dApps)** through the use of **smart contracts**, self-executing programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain without the need for intermediaries. These smart contracts enable services like ENS, where domain registration, updates, and management are automated and decentralized.
- **Curious Fact**: Ethereum underwent a major upgrade called "The Merge" in **September 2022**, transitioning from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to **Proof of Stake (PoS)**, making the network more energy efficient by reducing its energy consumption by **99.95%**.

##### **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**:
- **Overview**: **IPFS** is a peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a decentralized way. Rather than relying on a single server, files on IPFS are distributed across multiple nodes. When you upload a file to IPFS, it’s given a **Content Identifier (CID)**, a unique fingerprint that allows it to be retrieved from any IPFS node.
- **Launched in**: IPFS was developed by **Protocol Labs** and released in **2015**. It aims to decentralize the internet by replacing the traditional HTTP protocol with a content-addressed model.
- **How It Works**: Instead of looking for content at a specific server location (as in traditional web hosting), IPFS fetches content based on its unique CID, regardless of where it is stored. This ensures that content is always accessible as long as at least one node is storing it, making it censorship-resistant and more reliable.
- **Curious Fact**: Unlike traditional web hosting, where you pay for bandwidth and server space, **IPFS uses storage and bandwidth from everyone who participates** in the network. This model aligns with Web3's decentralized philosophy, making it more robust and resistant to censorship.

#### **Why It Matters**:

Understanding the basics of **ENS, Ethereum, and IPFS** is crucial because they represent the building blocks of a decentralized internet—**Web3**. The current web (often called Web2) relies on centralized services, meaning the data is stored on servers controlled by companies like Google, Amazon, or Facebook. This has led to concerns about data privacy, censorship, and monopolies over internet services.

With Web3:
- **ENS** provides user-friendly names that make decentralized services more accessible.
- **Ethereum** powers decentralized applications and smart contracts, removing the need for trusted third parties.
- **IPFS** allows you to host websites and content without relying on centralized servers, ensuring greater resilience and accessibility.

These technologies together create a future where you can **own your identity and data**, interact with decentralized apps, and build websites that are **censorship-resistant**, self-hosted on distributed networks, and free from traditional constraints.
